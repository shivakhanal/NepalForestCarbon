# NepalForestCarbon


Repository for plot-level Above Ground Biomass (AGB) and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) stocks modelling in Nepal. 
The R codes numbered from 1 to 5 calculate the plot-level forest AGB by implementing a set of analysis steps. The 6<sup>th</sup> R code (6_code_calculation_SOC.R) allows the analysis of plot level forest SOC. The final code ( number 7) combines the outputs related to plot-level forest AGB and SOC and writes the final data table.
